# Maze Game

This project demonstrates my ability to complete somthing complex, but also fun. 
It utilizes the stack and and DFS to randomly generate a maze that has a path from start to finish for both the player and enemy.
Uses Raylib for the visuals.

If I made this project again or reworked it, It would want to reorganize the code into different header and .cpp files, to make it easier to read and maintain.
    I would also build it in a way where the size of the maze is dynamically allocated at runtime. This was my original intention, but eventually I realized
    that the way I constructed the maze generation made the really difficult.
